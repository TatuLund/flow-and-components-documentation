= Loading From and Saving To Business Objects

Once your bindings are set up, you are ready to fill the bound UI components with data from your business objects. 

== Loading data to Binder

You can use the `reset()` method to read values from a business object instance into the UI components.


*Example*: Using the `reset()` method.

[source, typescript]
----
Employee employee = endpoint.getEmployee(1);

this.binder.reset(employee);
----

== Saving data

You can use the `submitTo()` method to submit the value to a callback. 

*Example*: Using the `submitTo()` method to submit to an endpoint method.

[source, typescript]
----
await this.binder.submitTo(viewEndpoint.saveEmployee);
----
