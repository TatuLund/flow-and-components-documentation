= Offline Form Submission

Our TypeScript <<../client-side-forms/tutorial-binder#,Binder>> works seamlessly with the <<tutorial-defer-endpoint-request#, deferrable endpoints>>, which allows your form submission to work both online and offline. 

When the application is online, the form will be submitted normally. When offline, the form will be cached locally in the browser and be submitted automatically when coming back online.

*Example*: Offline form submission with TypeScript Binder.
[source,typescript]
----
// import the remote endpoint
import * as personEndpoint from '../../generated/PersonEndpoint';

const deferrableResult = await this.binder.submitTo(personEndpoint.update);
if (deferrableResult.isDeferred) {
    // your offline logic
} else {
    const result = deferrableResult.result;
    // your online logic
}
