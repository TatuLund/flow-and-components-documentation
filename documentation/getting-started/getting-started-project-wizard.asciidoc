. Enter a *Maven Group ID*.
This is usually your corporation ID or a personal ID.
You are welcome to use one under `org.vaadin`, especially for open-source projects.

. Enter a *Project Name*.
It will also be used for the project ID in lowercase, with spaces replaced by dashes.

. Click *Download* _or_ proceed to customize it as described in <<#getting-started.project-wizard.customizing, Customizing a Project>>.

. Unzip the downloaded archive to a file location of your choice.

TIP: Avoid unzipping to the download folder, as you could unintentionally delete your project when clearing out old downloads.

Once you have the project unzipped, go on with importing it in your IDE as described in IDE specific sections.
