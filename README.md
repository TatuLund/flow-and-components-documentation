## The Vaadin documentation is moving to [vaadin/docs](https://github.com/vaadin/docs)

This old V10-18 documentation repository is no longer accepting contributions - please use vaadin/docs instead.
The open issues from this repository will be moved to the new docs repository later on.

The new docs site will be released in Q1 2021. The docs remain live in [vaadin.com](https://vaadin.com/docs).

The documentation for older Vaadin versions (10-17) can be found from the branches in this repository.
